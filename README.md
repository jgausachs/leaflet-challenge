# Leaflet Challenge
Submission for Challenge 15 - Leaflet

## Challenge Objective
The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualise their earthquake data.  
They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it.  
In this challenge, we develop a visualisation of the USGS data that will allow management to display key information about recent earthquakes so as to better educate the public and other government organisations  on issues facing our planet.

## Data
Data is that of "Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days" as sourced from the USGS GeoJSON page.  
The data markers show magnitude of each earthquake (on Richter scale) by size, as well as their depth by colour.  
Popups provide additional information about the earthquake are shown upon selecting the marker.
